His answer is [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6640067/automatically-add-activity-to-manifest):

When you have an Activity or a class that inherits from Activity at some point that has no mention in the AndroidManifest.xml you can press (`CMD/CTRL+N`) and press `add to manifest`. This adds the activity to the manifest.
